# Portfolio
## What I did 🚀
_I create a little portfolio with three sections: portfolio (with an image and a description of the work), about (where I present me and add links to my github repository and resume), contact (with all my contact info)._

## Content 🚀
_This Project only has one master branch, it was a small project so it did not need more branches._

## Builded with 🛠️

_**HTML 5** and **CSS3**_
