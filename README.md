## Project Structure🛠️

Inside of theo project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
├── public/
│   └── favicon.ico
|   ├── hero.png
|   └── ...
├── src/
|   ├── assets/
|   |   ├── images/
│   │   |   ├── hero.png
|   |   |   └── ...
│   ├── components/
│   │   ├── ui/
│   │   |   ├── BackToTop.astro
|   |   |   └── ...
│   │   ├── About.astro
│   │   ├── Contact.astro
|   |   └── ...
├── package.json
├──
└── ...
```

`src/components/` is where I put any components and similarly `src/layouts/` for layouts.

Images can be placed in `src/images/`.

Any static assets, eg. images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.
